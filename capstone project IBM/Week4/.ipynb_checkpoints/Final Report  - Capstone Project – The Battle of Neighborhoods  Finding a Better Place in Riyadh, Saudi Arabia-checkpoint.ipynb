    "## 1. Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this Project is to help people in exploring better facilities around their neighborhood. It will help people making smart and efficient decision on selecting great neighborhood out of numbers of other neighborhoods in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thsi project is for new movers to Riyadh to better decide on the neighbourhood. For ease of accessing to Cafe, School, Super market, medical shops, grocery shops, mall, theatre, hospital, like minded people, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "This Project aim to create an analysis of features for a people migrating to Riyadh to search a best neighborhood as a comparative analysis between neighborhoods. \n",
    "\n",
    "It will help people to get awareness of the area and neighborhood before moving to a new city, state, country or place for their work or to start a new fresh life.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Data Section\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riyadh\n",
    "\n",
    "The Neighbourhood list is taken from the above link and the longitude and latitude data will be gathered through scraping.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Foursquare API Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "We will need data about different venues in different neighborhoods. \n",
    "In order to gain that information we will use \"Foursquare\" locational information. Foursquare is a location data provider with information about all manner of venues and events within an area of interest. Such information includes venue names, locations, menus and even photos. As such, the foursquare location platform will be used as the sole data source since all the stated required information can be obtained through the API. \n",
    "\n",
    "After finding the list of neighborhoods, we then connect to the Foursquare API to gather information about venues inside each and every neighborhood.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data retrieved from Foursquare contained information of venues within a specified distance of the longitude and latitude of the postcodes. The information obtained per venue as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Neighborhood\n",
    "    2. Neighborhood Latitude\n",
    "    3. Neighborhood Longitude\n",
    "    4. Venue\n",
    "    5. Name of the venue e.g. the name of a store or restaurant\n",
    "    6. Venue Latitude\n",
    "    7. Venue Longitude\n",
    "    8. Venue Category\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Methodology Section\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Clustering Approach:\n",
    "To find miliarities between different neigbourhoods of the Riyadh City. To be able to do that, we need to cluster data which is a form of unsupervised machine learning: k-means clustering algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Work Flow:\n",
    "Using credentials of Foursquare API features of near-by places of the neighborhoods would be mined. Due to http request limitations the number of places per neighborhood parameter would reasonably be set to 100 and the radius parameter would be set to 500.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Results Section\n",
    "\n",
    "**Map of Clusters in Riyadh**\n",
    "> ![title](map.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Results: The neighbourhoods are divided into different groups based on similaritites\n",
    "\n",
    "**Heatmap of cluster 1 (purple)**\n",
    "Results: the gardens cafes and resturants are particularly prominent in the cluster\n",
    "> ![t](cluster1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Heatmap of cluster 6 (light blue)**\n",
    "Results: the middle eastern resturants and metrostations are particularly prominent in the cluster\n",
    "> ![t](cluster6.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Heatmap of cluster 15,16 (orange/yellow)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Results: Parks and coffee shops are prominent places in the yellow/orrange clusters\n",
    "\n",
    "> ![t](cluster15,16.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Location:\n",
    "Riyadh is a the Capital of Saudi Arabia. Almost 40% of the population is expatriates. As a result, it is one of the most diverse and multicultural areas. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Foursquare API:\n",
    "This project would use Four-square API as its prime data gathering source as it has a database of millions of places, especially their places API which provides the ability to perform location search, location sharing and details about a business.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Work Flow:\n",
    "Using credentials of Foursquare API features of near-by places of the neighborhoods would be mined. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Discussion Section\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem Which Tried to Solve:\n",
    "The major purpose of this project, is to suggest a better neighborhood in a new city for the person who are shiffting there. Social presence in society in terms of like minded people. Connectivity to the airport, bus stand, city center, markets and other daily needs things nearby.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Conclusion Section\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, using k-means cluster algorithm I separated the neighborhood into 20(Ten) different clusters, which have very-similar neighborhoods around them. \n",
    "\n",
    "I feel rewarded with the efforts and believe this course with all the topics covered is well worthy of appreciation.\n",
    "This project has shown me a practical application to resolve a real situation that has impacting personal and financial impact using Data Science tools.\n",
    "The mapping with Folium is a very powerful technique to consolidate information and make the analysis and decision better with confidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Future Works:\n",
    "This project can be continued for making it more precise in terms to find neighbourhood by collecting the housing price data. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Libraries Which are Used to Develope the Project:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Pandas: For creating and manipulating dataframes.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Folium: Python visualization library would be used to visualize the neighborhoods cluster distribution of using interactive leaflet map.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Scikit Learn: For importing k-means clustering.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> JSON: Library to handle JSON files.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> XML: To separate data from presentation and XML stores data in plain text format.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Geocoder: To retrieve Location Data.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Beautiful Soup and Requests: To scrap and library to handle http requests.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Matplotlib: Python Plotting Module.\n",
